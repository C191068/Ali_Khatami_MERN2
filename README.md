# Ali_Khatami_MERN2(Learning from the video of Mohammed Taheri)

### Prerequistic

For this at firstvwe need to have knowledge about javascript function and React <br>

we need to have node js install in our computer <br>

we can use VS code and chrome <br>

![m1](https://github.com/C191068/Ali_Khatami_MERN2/assets/89090776/8581ea7e-1134-4b41-bc5c-7558ede32e2d)

we have created the above folder for our project <br>

![m2](https://github.com/C191068/Ali_Khatami_MERN2/assets/89090776/b65676e6-577c-4264-a855-a010933fc1b8)

code:

```
npm init -y

```
we typed the above command for the package.json folder at backend <br>

![m3](https://github.com/C191068/Ali_Khatami_MERN2/assets/89090776/f28d318b-deec-4de9-a283-3fefedc42d2c)
we have use the line of code which is export keyword and import keyword <br>


now let us add two packages to our project express.js  and nodemon <br>

![m4](https://github.com/C191068/Ali_Khatami_MERN2/assets/89090776/ff571b90-b135-4848-9e2e-61cfab08610f)

code:

```
npm i express nodemon

```


then we typed the above command 



we will use  Express as our framework and will use nodemon for restarting our server automatically <br>


we will use nodemon for restarting our server automatically unchanged <br>


now add script to script section <br>


![m5](https://github.com/C191068/Ali_Khatami_MERN2/assets/89090776/18dcbf16-db0a-4918-b5d6-c0345308a417)


here start will run the project nodejs environment <br>


dev will run the project with nodemon <br>

we use these commands in development <br>


![m6](https://github.com/C191068/Ali_Khatami_MERN2/assets/89090776/f7d12001-bc1b-4b0d-b495-7dc3618d26cc)

here we have created a file name index.js it will be the stater of our project <br>



![m7](https://github.com/C191068/Ali_Khatami_MERN2/assets/89090776/3d1389e3-86c2-41d9-9bb8-df897764581c)


at first line we add express.js framework <br>

then by the second line we defined a new variable for it <br>


then we will mke it listen to a port <br>

it is better solution to seprate our code fom different files and folders <br>


![m8](https://github.com/C191068/Ali_Khatami_MERN2/assets/89090776/ff73ff90-511e-4dbe-86f5-1455c3a96e65)

For the port we have created the above file <br>

![m9](https://github.com/C191068/Ali_Khatami_MERN2/assets/89090776/6f721ac4-8312-4139-9930-2625eaf241e9)
 Thus we have defined our PORT in the above file <br>

 
![m10](https://github.com/C191068/Ali_Khatami_MERN2/assets/89090776/dffafd89-dbc0-4a9c-9eed-578db21a23ee)

we have import PORT by using the above line of code <br>


![m11](https://github.com/C191068/Ali_Khatami_MERN2/assets/89090776/c285db3e-93a2-4aa3-bdfc-48dc75d353d0)

we have use the above function for listening to our PORT, after PORT we pass a callback function  <br>
then we have used console.log to show everything is okay <br>
